# Unreleased

### Features

-   Improved support for `--entryPointStrategy Packages`. TypeDoc will now load package-specific configurations from `package.json` `typedoc` field. This configuration allows configuring a custom display name (`typedoc.displayName`) field, entry point (`typedoc.entryPoint` - this is equivalent and will override `typedocMain`), and path to a readme file to be rendered at the top of the package page (`typedoc.readmeFile`), #1658.
-   The `--includeVersion` option will now be respected by `--entryPointStrategy Packages`. Also, for this combination, missing `version` field in the root `package.json` will not issue a warning.

## v0.23.5 (2022-07-02)

### Features

-   The `DEBUG_SEARCH_WEIGHTS` global variable can now be set on `window` to add search scoring information in the search results.
-   TypeDoc's icons are now available on `DefaultThemeRenderContext.icons` for use/modification by themes.

## v0.23.4 (2022-07-02)

### Bug Fixes

-   TypeDoc no longer ignores project references if `--entryPointStrategy Packages` is set, #1976.
-   Boost computations are now done when creating the search index, resulting in a smaller `search.js` generated file.

### Features

-   The `--exclude` option will now be respected by `--entryPointStrategy Packages` and can be used to exclude package directories, #1959.
-   TypeDoc now emits an `IndexEvent` on the `Renderer` when preparing the search index, #1953.
-   Added new `--searchInComments` option to include comment text in the search index, #1553.
    Turning this option on will increase the size of your search index, potentially by an order of magnitude.

## v0.23.3 (2022-07-01)

### Bug Fixes

-   Function properties in type space will no longer be interpreted as methods, #1637.
-   TypeDoc will no longer crash if a comment contains an empty `@example` tag, #1967.
-   TypeDoc will now detect attempted inheritance from accessors and inherit from the getter or setter, #1968.
-   `intentionallyNotExported` will now properly respect qualified names, #1972.
-   Fixed missing namespace comments on `export * as NS` declarations, #1973.
-   Fixed missing comments on `export const x = () => 123` function variables, #1973.
-   Exported variable functions with properties will now be converted as a function+namespace instead of a variable+namespace, #1651.
-   Validation warnings caused by missing documentation will now be formatted like other warnings which reference a declaration.
-   TypeDoc will no longer warn if both the `get` and `set` signatures of an accessor have a comment.

### Features

-   Added `--htmlLang` option to set the [`lang`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang) attribute in the generated HTML. Defaults to `en`, #1951.
-   Added `--basePath` option to override TypeDoc's detected root directory, #1924.
-   Added support for TypeDoc specific `:getter` and `:setter` meaning keywords in declaration references.
-   Warnings caused by comment contents will now do a better job of including the location of the text that caused the warning.

## v0.23.2 (2022-06-28)

### Bug Fixes

-   Module comments will no longer be inappropriately attached to signatures, #1962.
-   Projects with a single entry point will now parse `@module` comments in the entry point, #1963.
-   Removed duplicate "in comment" warning when parsing comments, #1964.
-   Reflections with a boost of `<= 0` due to `searchCategoryBoosts` or `searchGroupBoosts` will be excluded from search.

## v0.23.1 (2022-06-26)

### Bug Fixes

-   If a declaration has multiple comments associated with it, the last one should be used, #1961.

# v0.23.0 (2022-06-26)

### Breaking Changes

-   Node 12 is no longer officially supported as it has gone end of life as of 2022-04-30. It might still work, but may stop working at any time.
-   Dropped support for TypeScript before 4.6.
-   `{@link}` tags in comments will now be resolved as declaration references similar to TSDoc's declaration references.
    For most cases, this will just work. See [the documentation](https://typedoc.org/guides/link-resolution/) for details on how link resolution works.
-   TypeDoc will now produce warnings for bracketed links (`[[ target ]]`). Use `{@link target}` instead. The `{@link}` syntax will be recognized by [TypeScript 4.3](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-3.html#editor-support-for-link-tags) and later and used to provide better intellisense. TypeDoc version 0.24.0 will remove support for `[[ target ]]` style links.
-   `extends` in typedoc.json is now resolved using NodeJS module resolution, so a local path must begin with `./`.
-   In the JSON output for `DeclarationReflection`s, `getSignature` is no longer a one-tuple.
-   In the JSON output for `DeclarationReflection`s, `setSignature` is no longer a one-tuple.
-   In the JSON output for `DeclarationReflection`s, `typeParameter` has been renamed to `typeParameters`
-   The `searchGroupBoosts` option must now be given the rendered group name rather than reflection kind names, and can be given custom group names.
-   `@inheritDoc` now follows the behavior specified by TSDoc when copying comments with a reference.
-   The `gaSite` option has been removed since Google Analytics now infers the site automatically, updated Google Analytics script to latest version, #1846.
-   The `hideLegend` option has been removed as the default theme no longer contains a legend.
-   Comments on export declarations will only overrides comments for references and namespaces, #1901.
-   The deprecated `listInvalidSymbolLinks` option has been removed. Use `validation.invalidLink` instead.
-   The deprecated `true` and `false` values have been removed from `--emit`, to migrate replace `true` with `"both"` and `false` with `"docs"` (the default).
-   Links are no longer be resolved against a global list of all symbols. See [the documentation](https://typedoc.org/guides/link-resolution/) for details on link resolution.
-   The `validation.invalidLink` option is now on by default.
-   `reflection.decorates`, `reflection.decorators`, and their corresponding interfaces have been removed as no code in TypeDoc used them.
-   The shape of the `Comment` class has changed significantly to support multiple tag kinds.
-   Listeners to `Converter.EVENT_CREATE_TYPE_PARAMETER` and `Converter.EVENT_CREATE_DECLARATION` will now never be passed a `ts.Node` as their third argument.
-   Constant variables which are interpreted as functions will no longer have the `ReflectionFlag.Const` flag set.
-   `reflection.defaultValue` is no longer set for enum members. The same information is available on `reflection.type` with more precision.
-   Removed deprecated `removeReaderByName`, `addDeclarations` and `removeDeclarationByName` methods on `Options`.
-   Removed `ProjectReflection.directory`, it was unused by TypeDoc and not properly tested.
-   Removed `ProjectReflection.files`, this was an internal cache that should not have been exposed, and shouldn't have existed in the first place, since removing it made TypeDoc faster.
-   Removed `ReflectionGroup.kind` since groups can now be created with the `@group` tag.
-   Removed `ReflectionKind.Event`, the `@event` tag is now an alias for `@group Events`. Note: This changes the value of `ReflectionKind.Reference` from `16777216` to `8388608`.
-   Themes are now set on the document element rather than on body, #1706.

### Features

-   TypeDoc now supports the `@group` tag to group reflections in a page. If no `@group` tag is specified, reflections will be grouped according to their kind, #1652.
-   TypeDoc will now search for `typedoc.js(on)` in the `.config` folder in the current working directory.
-   Entry point strategies `Resolve` and `Expand` may now specify globs, #1926.
-   `typedoc.json` now supports comments like `tsconfig.json`.
-   TypeDoc will now read the `blockTags`, `inlineTags`, and `modifierTags` out of `tsdoc.json` in the same directory as `tsconfig.json` if it exists.
    It is recommended to add `"extends": ["typedoc/tsdoc.json"]`, which defines TypeDoc specific tags to your `tsdoc.json` if you create one.
-   If an exported symbol has multiple declarations, TypeDoc will now check all appropriate declarations for comments, and warn if more than one declaration contains a comment, #1855.
-   Improved support for JSDoc style `@example` tags. If the tag content does not include a code block, TypeDoc now follows VSCode's behavior of treating the entire block as a code block, #135.
-   TypeDoc will now render members marked with `@deprecated` with a line through their name, #1381.
-   Added new `commentStyle` option which can be used to control what comments TypeDoc will parse.

    | Value | Behavior                               |
    | ----- | -------------------------------------- |
    | JSDoc | Use block comments starting with `/**` |
    | Block | Use all block comments                 |
    | Line  | Use `//` comments                      |
    | All   | Use both block and line comments       |

-   TypeDoc will now warn if part of a comment will be overwritten due to use of `@inheritDoc` instead of silently dropping part of the comment.
-   Added support for inline `@inheritDoc` tags, #1480.
-   It is now possible to link directly to a specific overload, #1326.
-   The JSON output will now include URLs to the file on the remote repository if possible.
-   Added a new `visibilityFilters` option which controls the available filters on a page.
-   TypeDoc will now try to place block elements on a new line in HTML output, resulting in less overwhelming diffs when rebuilding docs, #1923.
-   Added `blockTags`, `inlineTags`, `modifierTags` to control which tags TypeDoc will allow when parsing comments.
    If a tag not in in one of these options is encountered, TypeDoc will produce a warning and use context clues to determine how to parse the tag.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed off by one error in warnings for types referenced but not included in the documentation.
-   TypeDoc will no longer render a `Type Parameters` heading if there are no type parameters in some cases.
-   Improved source location detection for constructors.
-   Improved comment discovery on destructured exported functions, #1770.
-   Links which refer to members within a reference reflection will now correctly resolve to the referenced reflection's member, #1770.
-   Correctly detect optional parameters in JavaScript projects using JSDoc, #1804.
-   Fixed identical anchor links for reflections with the same name, #1845.
-   TypeDoc will now automatically inherit documentation from classes `implements` by other interfaces/classes.
-   Fixed `@inheritDoc` on accessors, #1927.
-   JS exports defined as `exports.foo = ...` will now be converted as variables rather than properties.
-   `searchCategoryBoosts` are now correctly computed for all categories, #1960.
-   The `excludeNotDocumented` option will no longer hide a module if it has a documentation comment, #1948.
-   Prevent `--excludeNotDocumented` from hiding properties of type literals (`a` in `function fn(p: { a: string })`), #1752.
-   Allow `cts` and `mts` extensions in packages resolution mode, #1952.
-   Corrected schema generation for https://typedoc.org/schema.json

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed invalid type output in some uncommon edge cases, TypeDoc also now renders fewer superfluous parenthesis when creating types.

## v0.22.10 (2021-11-25)

### Features

-   Added support for TypeScript 4.5, #1798.

### Bug Fixes

-   If file exports a symbol both under it's real name and as `default`, the `default` export will now always be the renamed symbol, #1795.
-   TypeDoc will no longer crash if a symbol is defined both as a normal class (and optional interface) and as a property, as is used for global Node types in older `@types/node` versions, Gerrit0/typedoc-plugin-missing-exports#5.

## v0.22.9 (2021-11-14)

### Features

-   TypeDoc will now detect and warn if multiple instances of the package are loaded. This usually means that a plugin has its own version of TypeDoc installed, which will lead to things breaking in unexpected ways.
    It will only work if both loaded TypeDocs are v0.22.9 or later.
-   TypeDoc will now automatically load packages with `typedoc-theme` in their keywords.
    Plugins which define a custom theme should include this keyword so that they can be automatically collected and displayed at https://typedoc.org/guides/themes/.

### Bug Fixes

-   Corrected HTML generation for projects using Google Analytics, #1786.
-   Ensured that the `<meta charset="utf-8" />` appears within the first 1024 bytes of generated pages, #1783.

### Thanks!

-   @RunDevelopment

## v0.22.8 (2021-11-07)

### Features

-   Added hooks which can be used to inject HTML without completely replacing a template, #1773.
    See the documentation in [custom-themes.md](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/blob/master/internal-docs/custom-themes.md) for details.

### Bug Fixes

-   Actually fixed `@category` tag incorrectly appearing on function types if used on a type alias, #1745.
-   Fix error in console when a page contains no documentation items.

### Thanks!

-   @RunDevelopment
-   @srmagura

## v0.22.7 (2021-10-25)

-   Fixed `@category` tag incorrectly appearing on function types if used on a type alias, #1745.
-   Fixed incorrect JS to apply themes on page load, #1709 (again).
-   Accessors and index signatures are now properly marked as inherited on declaration creation, #1742.

### Thanks!

-   @nlfurniss
-   @RunDevelopment
-   @srmagura

## v0.22.6 (2021-10-17)

### Features

-   Fixed improper quoting of `as const` style enums, #1727.
-   Fixed handling of `@typeParam` on type aliases, #1733.
-   Fixed handling of comment tags on function type aliases, #1734.
-   Paths in warnings about non-exported symbols are now consistently displayed across platforms, #1738.

### Thanks!

-   @capraynor
-   @srmagura

## v0.22.5 (2021-10-02)

### Features

-   TypeDoc will now recognize `@param` comments for destructured parameters and rename `__namedParameters` to the name specified
    in the `@param` comment if the number of `@param` comments match the number of parameters, resolves #1703.
-   The `intentionallyNotExported` option may now include file names/paths to limit its scope, for example, the following
    will suppress warnings from `Foo` in `src/foo.ts` not being exported, but will not suppress warnings if another `Foo`
    declared in `src/utils/foo.ts` is not exported.
    ```json
    {
        "intentionallyNotExported": ["src/foo.ts:Foo"]
    }
    ```
-   The `--emit` option can now be used to more finely control what TypeDoc will emit.
    | Value | Behavior |
    | --- | --- |
    | `both` | Emit both documentation and JS. |
    | `docs` | Emit documentation, but not JS (default). |
    | `none` | Emit nothing, just convert and run validation. |
    | `true` | Alias for `both`, for backwards compatibility. Will be removed in 0.23. |
    | `false` | Alias for `docs`, for backwards compatibility. Will be removed in 0.23. |

### Bug Fixes

-   TypeDoc will now only create one highlighter for rendering code, saving ~200-500ms for rendering time.
-   For compatibility with JSDoc, TypeDoc will now strip `<caption>` elements from `@example` tags, resolves #1679.
-   TypeScript's `emitDeclarationOnly` compiler option is now supported, resolves #1716.
-   Fixed discovery of tsconfig.json when the provided path ends in `.json`, resolves #1712.
-   Fixed a crash when converting the `globalThis` namespace, could only be caused by a plugin.

## v0.22.4 (2021-09-18)

### Features

-   Flag option types like `validation` can now be set to true/false to enable/disable all flags within them.
-   Source code links now work with Bitbucket repositories, resolves #1615.
-   Added `githubPages` option (default: true), which will create a `.nojekyll` page in the generated output, resolves #1680.

-   Comments on function implementations with overloaded signatures will now be correctly handled, fixes #1697.

### Thanks!

-   @srmagura

## v0.22.3 (2021-09-12)

### Bug Fixes

-   Switched the default highlighting themes back to `light-plus` and `dark-plus`, they were accidentally set to `min-light` and `min-dark` in v0.22.0.

### Features

-   Added new `validation` option which can be used to disable checks for non-exported symbols.
    On the command line, this can be specified with `--validation.notExported true`, or in an options file with:
    ```json
    {
        "validation": {
            "notExported": true
        }
    }
    ```
-   Added invalidLink to `validation` option, deprecated `listInvalidSymbolLinks`, which will be removed in 0.23.

## v0.22.2 (2021-09-11)

### Bug Fixes

-   Fix background color of tables in dark mode, closes #1684.

## v0.22.1 (2021-09-10)

### Bug Fixes

-   Validation for non-exported symbols will now only produce one warning per symbol, instead of one warning per reference.
-   Syntax highlighting when the preferred color scheme is dark but dark theme is not explicitly selected will now properly use the dark highlighting theme.

# v0.22.0 (2021-09-10)

### Breaking Changes

-   The `packages` and `entryPoints` options have been combined.
    To migrate configurations which used `packages`, replace `packages` with `entryPoints` and set `entryPointStrategy` to `packages`.
-   Renamed `disableOutputCheck` to `cleanOutputDir` to more clearly reflect its behavior.
-   The `highlightTheme` option has been split into `lightHighlightTheme` and `darkHighlightTheme`.
-   Removed poorly documented / poorly behaved `toc` option.
-   HTML output is now rendered with JSX instead of Handlebars, closes #1631.
    This change provides major performance benefits, reducing rendering time by up to 10x for several benchmarked projects.
    It also allows themes to be easily type checked, preventing mistakes when creating custom themes.
    Removing Handlebars also fixed memory leaks when `--watch` was specified due to Handlebar's caching mechanism.
    This change breaks all existing custom themes, so a theme created for v0.21 or earlier will not work in v0.22.
    See [internal-docs/custom-themes.md](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/blob/v0.22.0/internal-docs/custom-themes.md) for documentation on how to create a custom theme in v0.22.
-   Removed the minimal theme that has been mostly broken for a long time.
-   Changed the default `entryPointStrategy` from `expand` to `resolve`.
-   Paths in config files will now be resolved relative to the config file instead of relative to the current working directory.
-   Exclude patterns are now checked against files instead of against each part of the path as traversed, #1399.
    This means that an exclude of `**/someDir` will **not** exclude files in that directory. To exclude files in a directory, specify `**/someDir/**`.

### Features

-   Added support for light/dark mode to the default theme, closes #1641.
-   Added support for custom CSS with the new `customCss` option, closes #1060.
-   Added support for linking to third party documentation sites, closes #131. See [internal-docs/third-party-symbols.md](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/blob/v0.22.0/internal-docs/third-party-symbols.md)
    for documentation on how to create a plugin which enables this.
    Support for linking to MDN for global types is provided by [typedoc-plugin-mdn-links](https://github.com/Gerrit0/typedoc-plugin-mdn-links).
-   Added `entryPointStrategy` to reduce confusion from new TypeDoc users on handling of entry points.
    There are three possible options:
    | Option | Behavior |
    | --- | --- |
    | resolve (default) | Expects all entry points to be contained within the root level tsconfig project. If a directory is given, includes `<directory>/index` as the entry point. |
    | expand | Expects all entry points to be contained within the root level tsconfig project. If a directory is given, files within it are recursively expanded. This was the default behavior in v0.21. |
    | packages | Corresponds to `--packages` in v0.21, behaves as documented in the Monorepo section in the readme. |
-   Added support for `typedocMain` in package.json when using the `packages` strategy for resolving entry points.
-   Produce warnings when documentation is missing exports, closes #1653. If using TypeDoc's API, this behavior is available through calling `application.validate(project)`.
-   Added support for detecting "`as const` enums", closes #1675.
-   Added `hideLegend` option, closes #1108.
-   Added performance measurements to debug logging (`--logLevel Verbose`)
-   String literal indexed access types will create links to their referencing member if possible, closes #1226.

### Bug Fixes

-   Support inclusion patterns when expanding input files, closes #1399.
-   Arrow keys can no longer select hidden search results.
-   The Legend header will no longer be included if there is nothing in the legend.
-   If a non-function uses `@param`, the name will not be dropped when rendering, closes #1410.

### API Breaking Changes

-   TypeDoc now specifies the `"export"` key in `package.json`, preventing plugins from importing internal paths.
    TypeDoc should now export all necessary structures (potentially marked with `@internal` if likely to change) from the root export.
-   The `ReflectionKind` values for `Project`, `Module`, `Namespace`, and `Enum` have changed.
-   Removed deprecated logger functions.
-   Dropped support for legacy plugins which use `export=`. Plugins are now required to export a `load` function.
-   Remove `TypeParameterType`, references to type parameters have produced a `ReferenceType` since v0.20.0.
-   Types no longer have a `clone` method. It inconsistently performed deep or shallow clones, and was not used by TypeDoc.
-   Types no longer contain an `equals` method. It was occasionally correct for medium-complexity types, and always incorrect for more complicated types.
