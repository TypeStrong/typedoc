# Unreleased

### Features

-   Added `stripYamlFrontmatter` config option, #2381.
-   Navigation is now written to a JS file and built dynamically, which significantly decreases document generation time
    with large projects and also provides large space benefits. Themes may now override `DefaultTheme.buildNavigation`
    to customize the displayed navigation tree, #2287.
    Note: This change renders `navigation.fullTree` obsolete. If you set it, TypeDoc will warn that it is being ignored.
    It will be removed in v0.26.
-   TypeDoc will now attempt to cache icons when `DefaultThemeRenderContext.icons` is overwritten by a custom theme.
    Note: To perform this optimization, TypeDoc relies on `DefaultThemeRenderContext.iconCache` being rendered within
    each page. TypeDoc does it in the `defaultLayout` template.

### Bug Fixes

-   `@property` now works as expected if used to override a method's documentation.
-   Deprecated functions/methods are now correctly rendered with a struck-out name.
-   `--watch` mode works again, #2378.
-   Improved support for optional names within JSDoc types, #2384.
-   Fixed duplicate rendering of reflection flags on signature parameters, #2385.
-   TypeDoc now handles the `intrinsic` keyword if TS intrinsic types are included in documentation.

-   Removed `ReflectionKind.ObjectLiteral` that was never used by TypeDoc.
-   Removed deprecated members `DefaultThemeRenderContext.comment` and `DefaultThemeRenderContext.attemptExternalResolution`.

### Features

-   Added support for TypeScript 5.2, #2373.
-   TypeDoc config files now support options default-exported from an ESM config file, #2268.
-   TypeDoc config files may now export a promise containing configuration, #2268.
-   Added `--preserveLinkText` option (defaults to true) which determines whether the reflection name or full link text is included
    in the output when no override is specified, #2355.
-   Added a no-results placeholder when no search results are available, #2347.
-   Implemented several miscellaneous performance improvements to generate docs faster, this took the time to generate TypeDoc's
    site from ~5.6 seconds to ~5.4 seconds.
-   Added `--disableGit` option to prevent TypeDoc from using Git to try to determine if sources can be linked, #2326.
-   Added support for tags `@showGroups`, `@hideGroups`, `@showCategories`, `@hideCategories` to configure the navigation pane on a
    per-reflection basis, #2329.
-   With `--jsDocCompatibility.defaultTags` set, `@defaultValue` is now implicitly a code block if the text contains no code, #2370.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed link discovery if nested (`Foo#bar`) links were used and `--useTsLinkResolution` is enabled in some cases, #2360.
-   Links with invalid declaration references will no longer silently link to the wrong page in some cases, #2360.
-   Fixed duplicate definitions in type hierarchy when using packages mode, #2327.
-   `@inheritDoc` was not properly resolved across packages in packages mode, #2331.
-   Added warning for attempted `@interface` use on union types, #2352.
-   Fixed misleading type annotation on `Theme.getUrls`, #2318.
-   Fixed duplicate namespace in documentation if `@namespace` is used on a variable with an associated namespace, #2364.
-   Fixed `@namespace` property discovery if merged with a type and the type was declared first #2364.
-   Tables in markdown are now styled, #2366.
-   Sidebar links no longer open in a new tab, #2353.
-   Headers now include some padding before rendering text, #2316.

## v0.24.8 (2023-06-04)

### Features

-   Added support for TypeScript 5.1, #2296.
-   Added `navigation.fullTree` to control rendering the full navigation tree on each page, #2287.
    This option will likely be replaced in 0.25 with dynamic loading of the full tree.

    and any other block tags in the order they are defined in the comment, #2285.
-   Comments are no longer removed from classes/interfaces containing call signatures, #2290.

### Thanks!

-   @krisztianb
-   @WikiRik

## v0.24.7 (2023-05-08)

### Features

-   TypeDoc will now allow conversion without any entry points to support "readme only" packages, #2264.

### Bug Fixes

-   Category children are now sorted according to the `sort` option, #2272.
-   Inline tags no longer require a space after the tag name to be parsed as a tag, #2273.
-   Fixed module/namespace links in navigation when viewed in Safari, #2275.

## v0.24.6 (2023-04-24)

### Features

-   Improved error messaging if a provided entry point could not be converted into a documented module reflection, #2242.
-   API: Added support for `g`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `polygon`, and `polyline` svg elements, #2259.
-   Extended `jsDocCompatibility` option with `inheritDocTag` to ignore fully lowercase `inheritDoc` tags and
    `ignoreUnescapedBraces` to disable warnings about unescaped `{` and `}` characters in comments.

### Bug Fixes

-   `--useTsLinkResolution` is no longer ignored within block tags, #2260.
-   The current namespace will also be expanded in the navigation on page load, #2260.

### Thanks!

-   @FlippieCoetser

## v0.24.5 (2023-04-22)

### Features

-   Categories and groups can now be shown in the navigation, added `--navigation.includeCategories`
    and `--navigation.includeGroups` to control this behavior. The `--categorizeByGroup` option also
    effects this behavior. If `categorizeByGroup` is set (the default) and `navigation.includeGroups` is
    _not_ set, the value of `navigation.includeCategories` will be effectively ignored since categories
    will be created only within groups, #1532.
-   Added support for discovering a "module" comment on global files, #2165.
-   Added copy code to clipboard button, #2153.
-   Function `@returns` blocks will now be rendered with the return type, #2180.
-   Added `--groupOrder` option to specify the sort order of groups, #2251.

### Bug Fixes

-   Type parameter constraints now respect the `--hideParameterTypesInTitle` option, #2226.
-   Even more contrast fixes, #2248.
-   Fix semantic highlighting for predicate type's parameter references, #2249.
-   Fixed broken links to heading titles.
-   Fixed inconsistent styling between type parameter lists and parameter lists.
-   TypeDoc will now warn if more than one `@returns` block is is present in a function, and ignore the duplicate blocks as specified by TSDoc.

### Thanks!

-   @FlippieCoetser

## v0.24.4 (2023-04-16)

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed broken semantic coloring, #2247.
-   Increased contrast for parameter titles in dark mode to meet WCAG AA contrast requirements, #2244.
-   Underline color of index links now matches the text color, #2245.
-   Increased contract for active menu item text in dark mode.

## v0.24.3 (2023-04-16)

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed path expansion on Windows preventing generation, #2243 and #2241.

## v0.24.2 (2023-04-15)

### Features

-   Added semantic link coloring for reflection names & links, #2227.
    Note: This resulted in function signatures becoming too busy for easy scanning with even slightly
    complicated signatures as such, TypeDoc now only renders parameter names in the signature title
    and includes the type in the parameter details as usual. This can be controlled with the new
    `--hideParameterTypesInTitle` option.
-   Conditional types will now render their branches on the next line for easier comprehension.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed `&` showing as `&amp;` and HTML text showing up in page contents navigation, #2224.
-   Increased padding between sections when one navigation column is displayed, #2225.
-   Correct padding for navigation elements with a displayed icon, #2229.
-   Fixed `source-order` sort strategy failing to compare reflections within a file.
-   Added `enum-member-source-order` specialization of the `source-order` sort strategy which only compares enum members, #2237.
-   Updated highlight colors for semantic links to meet WCAG AA contrast requirements, #2228.
-   Type parameters are now highlighted consistently, #2230.
-   Fixed semantic coloring in type and function signatures, #2227.
-   Fixed issue where removing a reflection indirectly containing an object/function type would only partially remove the reflection, #2231.
-   Fixed "Implementation of X.y" links if a mixture of methods and property-methods are used, #2233.
-   "Implementation of" text to symbol-properties not contained in the documentation will now use the resolved name instead of a `__@` symbol name, #2234.
-   Fix expansion of globs if a single entry point is provided, #2235.
-   Validation will no longer be skipped for sub packages when running with `--entryPointStrategy packages`.
-   Fixed broken theme toggle if the page contained a member named "theme".

### Thanks!

-   @RunDevelopment

## v0.24.1 (2023-04-09)

### Bug Fixes

-   Improve detection for legacy JSDoc `@example` tags, #2222.
-   The page footer will now appear at the bottom of the page even if the page is short, #2223.

# v0.24.0 (2023-04-08)

### Breaking Changes

-   `@link`, `@linkcode` and `@linkplain` tags will now be resolved with TypeScript's link resolution by default. The `useTsLinkResolution` option
    can be used to turn this behavior off, but be aware that doing so will mean your links will be resolved differently by editor tooling and TypeDoc.
-   TypeDoc will no longer automatically load plugins from `node_modules`. Specify the `--plugin` option to indicate which modules should be loaded.
-   The `packages` entry point strategy will now run TypeDoc in each provided package directory and then merge the results together.
    The previous `packages` strategy has been preserved under `legacy-packages` and will be removed in 0.25. If the new strategy does not work
    for your use case, please open an issue.
-   Removed `--logger` option, to disable all logging, set the `logLevel` option to `none`.
-   Dropped support for legacy `[[link]]`s, removed deprecated `Reflection.findReflectionByName`.
-   Added `@overload` to default ignored tags.

### API Breaking Changes

-   The `label` property on `Reflection` has moved to `Comment`.
-   The default value of the `out` option has been changed from `""` to `"./docs"`, #2195.
-   Renamed `DeclarationReflection#version` to `DeclarationReflection#projectVersion` to match property on `ProjectReflection`.
-   Removed unused `Reflection#originalName`.
-   Removed `Reflection#kindString`, use `ReflectionKind.singularString(reflection.kind)` or `ReflectionKind.pluralString(reflection.kind)` instead.
-   The `named-tuple-member` and `template-literal` type kind have been replaced with `namedTupleMember` and `templateLiteral`, #2100.
-   Properties related to rendering are no longer stored on `Reflection`, including `url`, `anchor`, `hasOwnDocument`, and `cssClasses`.
-   `Application.bootstrap` will no longer load plugins. If you want to load plugins, use `Application.bootstrapWithPlugins` instead, #1635.
-   The options passed to `Application.bootstrap` will now be applied both before _and_ after reading options files, which may cause a change in configuration
    if using a custom script to run TypeDoc that includes some options, but other options are set in config files.
-   Moved `sources` property previously declared on base `Reflection` class to `DeclarationReflection` and `SignatureReflection`.
-   Moved `relevanceBoost` from `ContainerReflection` to `DeclarationReflection` since setting it on the parent class has no effect.
-   Removed internal `ReferenceType.getSymbol`, reference types no longer reference the `ts.Symbol` to enable generation from serialized JSON.
-   `OptionsReader.priority` has been renamed to `OptionsReader.order` to more accurately reflect how it works.
-   `ReferenceType`s which point to type parameters will now always be intentionally broken since they were never linked and should not be warned about when validating exports.
-   `ReferenceType`s now longer include an `id` property for their target. They now instead include a `target` property.
-   Removed `Renderer.addExternalSymbolResolver`, use `Converter.addExternalSymbolResolver` instead.
-   Removed `CallbackLogger`.
-   Removed `SerializeEventData` from serialization events.
-   A `PageEvent` is now required for `getRenderContext`. If caching the context object, `page` must be updated when `getRenderContext` is called.
-   `PageEvent` no longer includes the `template` property. The `Theme.render` method is now expected to take the template to render the page with as its second argument.
-   Removed `secondaryNavigation` member on `DefaultThemeRenderContext`.
-   Renamed `navigation` to `sidebar` on `DefaultThemeRenderContext` and `navigation.begin`/`navigation.end` hooks to `sidebar.begin`/`sidebar.end`.

### Features

-   Added `--useTsLinkResolution` option (on by default) which tells TypeDoc to use TypeScript's `@link` resolution.
-   Added `--jsDocCompatibility` option (on by default) which controls TypeDoc's automatic detection of code blocks in `@example` and `@default` tags.
-   Reworked default theme navigation to add support for a page table of contents, #1478, #2189.
-   Added support for `@interface` on type aliases to tell TypeDoc to convert the fully resolved type as an interface, #1519
-   Added support for `@namespace` on variable declarations to tell TypeDoc to convert the variable as a namespace, #2055.
-   Added support for `@prop`/`@property` to specify documentation for a child property of a symbol, intended for use with `@interface`.
-   TypeDoc will now produce more informative error messages for options which cannot be set from the cli, #2022.
-   TypeDoc will now attempt to guess what option you may have meant if given an invalid option name.
-   Plugins may now return a `Promise<void>` from their `load` function, #185.
-   TypeDoc now supports plugins written with ESM, #1635.
-   Added `Renderer.preRenderAsyncJobs` and `Renderer.postRenderAsyncJobs`, which may be used by plugins to perform async processing for rendering, #185.
    Note: Conversion is still intentionally a synchronous process to ensure stability of converted projects between runs.
-   TypeDoc options may now be set under the `typedocOptions` key in `package.json`, #2112.
-   Added `--cacheBust` option to tell TypeDoc to include include the generation time in files, #2124.
-   Added `--excludeReferences` option to tell TypeDoc to omit re-exports of a symbol already included from the documentation.
-   Introduced new render hooks `pageSidebar.begin` and `pageSidebar.end`.

### Bug Fixes

-   TypeDoc will now ignore package.json files not containing a `name` field, #2190.
-   Fixed `@inheritDoc` on signatures (functions, methods, constructors, getters, setters) being unable to inherit from a non-signature.
-   Interfaces/classes created via extending a module will no longer contain variables/functions where the member should have been converted as properties/methods, #2150.
-   TypeDoc will now ignore a leading `v` in versions, #2212.
-   Category titles now render with the same format in the page index and heading title, #2196.
-   Fixed crash when using `typeof` on a reference with type arguments, #2220.
-   Fixed broken anchor links generated to signatures nested within objects.

## v0.23.25 (2023-02-11)

### Breaking Changes

-   Upgraded Shiki, if your highlight theme was set to `material-<theme>`, the value will need to be changed to
    `material-theme-<theme>`, see the [Shiki release notes](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0130--2023-01-27).

### Features

-   Added new `excludeNotDocumentedKinds` variable to control which reflection types can be removed
    by the `excludeNotDocumented` option, #2162.
-   Added `typedoc.jsonc`, `typedoc.config.js`, `typedoc.config.cjs`, `typedoc.cjs` to the list of files
    which TypeDoc will automatically use as configuration files.

### Thanks!

-   @mistic100

## v0.23.20 (2022-11-03)

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed comment discovery for `@inheritDoc` if inheriting from a function type alias, #2087.

## v0.23.19 (2022-10-28)

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed title link if `titleLink` option was not specified, #2085.

### Thanks!

-   @krisztianb

## v0.23.18 (2022-10-23)

### Features

-   Improved error reporting when failing to find entry points, #2080, #2082.

-   Fixed display of object types containing methods, #1788.
-   Fixed conversion of intrinsic string mapping types when converting without a type node, #2079.

## v0.23.17 (2022-10-18)

### Features

-   Added `titleLink`, `navigationLinks` and `sidebarLinks` options to add additional links to the rendered output, #1830.
-   Added `sourceLinkTemplate` option to allow more flexible specification of remote urls.
    Deprecated now redundant `gitRevision` detection starting with `https?://` introduced in v0.23.16, #2068.

### Thanks!

-   @futurGH

## v0.23.16 (2022-10-10)

### Features

-   Object types will now be pretty printed, #1793.
-   Added support for specifying the tsconfig.json file in packages mode with `{ "typedoc": { "tsconfig": "tsconfig.lib.json" }}` in package.json, #2061.
-   In packages mode, readme files will now be automatically included if present, #2065.
-   Added support for specifying the base file url for links to source code, #2068.

### Bug Fixes

-   Private parameter properties will no longer be ignored, #2064.

### Thanks!

-   @captainTorch

## v0.23.15 (2022-09-18)

### Features

-   TypeDoc will now treat `@typedef {import("foo").Bar<Z>} Baz` type declarations which forward type parameters to the imported
    symbol as re-exports of that symbol, #2044.

### Bug Fixes

-   TypeDoc will now prefer comments on variable declarations over signature comments, #2042.
-   Fixed double rendering of "Type Parameters" header, #2054.
-   Fixed double rendering of "Hierarchy" header, #2053.
-   Removed unused `widgets.png` and `widgets@2x.png` files from generated assets folder.

## v0.23.14 (2022-09-03)

### Features

-   Added support for defining one-off external link mappings with `externalSymbolLinkMappings` see
    [the documentation](https://typedoc.org/options/comments/#externalsymbollinkmappings) for usage examples and caveats, #2030.
-   External link resolvers defined with `addUnknownSymbolResolver` will now be checked when resolving `@link` tags, #2030.
    Note: To support this, resolution will now happen during conversion, and as such, `Renderer.addUnknownSymbolResolver` has been
    soft deprecated in favor of `Converter.addUnknownSymbolResolver`. Plugins should update to use the method on `Converter`.
    `DefaultThemeRenderContext.attemptExternalResolution` has also been deprecated since it will repeat work done during conversion,
    use `ReferenceType.externalUrl` instead.
-   Added `Converter.addUnknownSymbolResolver` for use by plugins supporting external links.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed conversion of object literal types containing construct signatures, #2036.
-   Fixed centering of title bar on wide displays, actually this time, #2046.

### Thanks!

-   @citkane

## v0.23.11 (2022-08-26)

### Features

-   Added support for TypeScript 4.8.
-   Introduced a `skipErrorChecking` option which instructs TypeDoc to not ask TypeScript for compiler errors
    before attempting to generate documentation. Turning this on may improve generation speed, but could also
    cause a crash if your code contains compiler errors.
-   Added support for JS entry points when using packages mode, #2037.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed crash when converting abstract mixin class, #2011.
-   Readme files within monorepos now have `@link` tags resolved, #2029.
-   Correctly resolve unqualified links to class members within parameters, #2031.
-   TypeDoc will now consider other reflections with the same name as parents when resolving links, #2033.
-   The "Hierarchy" and "Type Parameters" helpers on `DefaultThemeRenderContext` now contain all the HTML for their sections of the page, #2038.

### Thanks!

-   @citkane

-   Expose `Converter.resolveLinks` method for use with `Converter.parseRawComment`, #2004.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed schema URL for TSDoc preventing the use of `typedoc/tsdoc.json` in TSDoc extends, #2015.
-   Improved detection of package names in repositories using pnpm, #2017.
-   Fixed missing JSDoc style `@typedef` comments for properties, #2020.

### Thanks!

-   @bodil
-   @nazarhussain

## v0.23.9 (2022-07-24)

### Bug Fixes

-   TypeDoc will no longer skip entry points which have no exports, #2007.
    If using `"entryPointStrategy": "expand"`, this change may result in new pages being added to your documentation.
    If this is not desired, you can use the `exclude` option to filter them out.
-   Fixed missing comments on callable variable-functions constructed indirectly, #2008.
-   Packages mode will now respect the `--includeVersion` flag, #2010.
-   Fixed multiple reflections mapping to the same file name on case insensitive file systems, #2012.

## v0.23.8 (2022-07-17)

### Features

-   Added defined in links for classes, enums, #180.
-   Added support for `*.ghe.com` and `*.github.us` GitHub enterprise domains for source links, #2001.

### Bug Fixes

-   TypeDoc will no longer emit a warning for `{@link}` containing a URL, #1980.
-   `excludeNotDocumented` will no longer remove functions/methods/accessors which are documented, #1994.
-   Fixed missing `sources` property on signature reflections #1996.

### Thanks!

## v0.23.7 (2022-07-09)

### Bug Fixes

-   Tags must now contain whitespace after the tag name to be parsed as a tag, `@jest/globals` in a comment will no longer be parsed as a tag #1990.
-   The private member visibility option will now be respected in generated sites, #1992.
-   Overload rendering will no longer be broken if JavaScript is disabled, #453.
-   All overloads are now shown at once rather than requiring clicks to see the documentation for each signature, #1100.

## v0.23.6 (2022-07-08)

### Features

-   Improved support for `--entryPointStrategy Packages`. TypeDoc will now load package-specific configurations from `package.json` `typedoc` field. This configuration allows configuring a custom display name (`typedoc.displayName`) field, entry point (`typedoc.entryPoint` - this is equivalent and will override `typedocMain`), and path to a readme file to be rendered at the top of the package page (`typedoc.readmeFile`), #1658.
-   The `--includeVersion` option will now be respected by `--entryPointStrategy Packages`. Also, for this combination, missing `version` field in the root `package.json` will not issue a warning.
-   The `navigation` partial will now call the new `settings`, `primaryNavigation`, and `secondaryNavigation` partials, #1987.

### Bug Fixes

-   All warnings will be reported instead of only the first warning of a given type, #1981.
-   Include references will no longer be incorrectly parsed as links, #1986.
-   The generated schema.json on the website will now use enum values rather than enum names if possible.

### Thanks!

## v0.23.5 (2022-07-02)

### Features

-   The `DEBUG_SEARCH_WEIGHTS` global variable can now be set on `window` to add search scoring information in the search results.
-   TypeDoc's icons are now available on `DefaultThemeRenderContext.icons` for use/modification by themes.

## v0.23.4 (2022-07-02)

### Bug Fixes

-   TypeDoc no longer ignores project references if `--entryPointStrategy Packages` is set, #1976.
-   Boost computations are now done when creating the search index, resulting in a smaller `search.js` generated file.

### Features

-   The `--exclude` option will now be respected by `--entryPointStrategy Packages` and can be used to exclude package directories, #1959.
-   TypeDoc now emits an `IndexEvent` on the `Renderer` when preparing the search index, #1953.
-   Added new `--searchInComments` option to include comment text in the search index, #1553.
    Turning this option on will increase the size of your search index, potentially by an order of magnitude.

## v0.23.3 (2022-07-01)

### Bug Fixes

-   Function properties in type space will no longer be interpreted as methods, #1637.
-   TypeDoc will no longer crash if a comment contains an empty `@example` tag, #1967.
-   TypeDoc will now detect attempted inheritance from accessors and inherit from the getter or setter, #1968.
-   `intentionallyNotExported` will now properly respect qualified names, #1972.
-   Fixed missing namespace comments on `export * as NS` declarations, #1973.
-   Fixed missing comments on `export const x = () => 123` function variables, #1973.
-   Exported variable functions with properties will now be converted as a function+namespace instead of a variable+namespace, #1651.
-   Validation warnings caused by missing documentation will now be formatted like other warnings which reference a declaration.
-   TypeDoc will no longer warn if both the `get` and `set` signatures of an accessor have a comment.

### Features

-   Added `--htmlLang` option to set the [`lang`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang) attribute in the generated HTML. Defaults to `en`, #1951.
-   Added `--basePath` option to override TypeDoc's detected root directory, #1924.
-   Added support for TypeDoc specific `:getter` and `:setter` meaning keywords in declaration references.
-   Warnings caused by comment contents will now do a better job of including the location of the text that caused the warning.

## v0.23.2 (2022-06-28)

### Bug Fixes

-   Module comments will no longer be inappropriately attached to signatures, #1962.
-   Projects with a single entry point will now parse `@module` comments in the entry point, #1963.
-   Removed duplicate "in comment" warning when parsing comments, #1964.
-   Reflections with a boost of `<= 0` due to `searchCategoryBoosts` or `searchGroupBoosts` will be excluded from search.

## v0.23.1 (2022-06-26)

### Bug Fixes

-   If a declaration has multiple comments associated with it, the last one should be used, #1961.

# v0.23.0 (2022-06-26)

### Breaking Changes

-   Node 12 is no longer officially supported as it has gone end of life as of 2022-04-30. It might still work, but may stop working at any time.
-   Dropped support for TypeScript before 4.6.
-   `{@link}` tags in comments will now be resolved as declaration references similar to TSDoc's declaration references.
    For most cases, this will just work. See [the documentation](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc-site/blob/da9760bccf30ce96210f6e35b9dcc2a4ddeed234/guides/link-resolution.md) for details on how link resolution works.
-   TypeDoc will now produce warnings for bracketed links (`[[ target ]]`). Use `{@link target}` instead. The `{@link}` syntax will be recognized by [TypeScript 4.3](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-3.html#editor-support-for-link-tags) and later and used to provide better intellisense. TypeDoc version 0.24.0 will remove support for `[[ target ]]` style links.
    Support for ``[[`links`]]`` with brackets + code ticks have been dropped.
-   `extends` in typedoc.json is now resolved using NodeJS module resolution, so a local path must begin with `./`.
-   In the JSON output for `DeclarationReflection`s, `getSignature` is no longer a one-tuple.
-   In the JSON output for `DeclarationReflection`s, `setSignature` is no longer a one-tuple.
-   In the JSON output for `DeclarationReflection`s, `typeParameter` has been renamed to `typeParameters`
-   The `searchGroupBoosts` option must now be given the rendered group name rather than reflection kind names, and can be given custom group names.
-   `@inheritDoc` now follows the behavior specified by TSDoc when copying comments with a reference.
-   The `gaSite` option has been removed since Google Analytics now infers the site automatically, updated Google Analytics script to latest version, #1846.
-   The `hideLegend` option has been removed as the default theme no longer contains a legend.
-   Comments on export declarations will only overrides comments for references and namespaces, #1901.
-   The deprecated `listInvalidSymbolLinks` option has been removed. Use `validation.invalidLink` instead.
-   The deprecated `true` and `false` values have been removed from `--emit`, to migrate replace `true` with `"both"` and `false` with `"docs"` (the default).
-   Links are no longer be resolved against a global list of all symbols. See [the documentation](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc-site/blob/da9760bccf30ce96210f6e35b9dcc2a4ddeed234/guides/link-resolution.md) for details on link resolution.
-   The `validation.invalidLink` option is now on by default.
-   `reflection.decorates`, `reflection.decorators`, and their corresponding interfaces have been removed as no code in TypeDoc used them.
-   The shape of the `Comment` class has changed significantly to support multiple tag kinds.
-   Listeners to `Converter.EVENT_CREATE_TYPE_PARAMETER` and `Converter.EVENT_CREATE_DECLARATION` will now never be passed a `ts.Node` as their third argument.
-   Constant variables which are interpreted as functions will no longer have the `ReflectionFlag.Const` flag set.
-   `reflection.defaultValue` is no longer set for enum members. The same information is available on `reflection.type` with more precision.
-   Removed deprecated `removeReaderByName`, `addDeclarations` and `removeDeclarationByName` methods on `Options`.
-   Removed `ProjectReflection.directory`, it was unused by TypeDoc and not properly tested.
-   Removed `ProjectReflection.files`, this was an internal cache that should not have been exposed, and shouldn't have existed in the first place, since removing it made TypeDoc faster.
-   Removed `ReflectionGroup.kind` since groups can now be created with the `@group` tag.
-   Removed `ReflectionKind.Event`, the `@event` tag is now an alias for `@group Events`. Note: This changes the value of `ReflectionKind.Reference` from `16777216` to `8388608`.
-   Themes are now set on the document element rather than on body, #1706.

### Features

-   TypeDoc now supports the `@group` tag to group reflections in a page. If no `@group` tag is specified, reflections will be grouped according to their kind, #1652.
-   TypeDoc will now search for `typedoc.js(on)` in the `.config` folder in the current working directory.
-   Entry point strategies `Resolve` and `Expand` may now specify globs, #1926.
-   `typedoc.json` now supports comments like `tsconfig.json`.
-   TypeDoc will now read the `blockTags`, `inlineTags`, and `modifierTags` out of `tsdoc.json` in the same directory as `tsconfig.json` if it exists.
    It is recommended to add `"extends": ["typedoc/tsdoc.json"]`, which defines TypeDoc specific tags to your `tsdoc.json` if you create one.
-   If an exported symbol has multiple declarations, TypeDoc will now check all appropriate declarations for comments, and warn if more than one declaration contains a comment, #1855.
-   Improved support for JSDoc style `@example` tags. If the tag content does not include a code block, TypeDoc now follows VSCode's behavior of treating the entire block as a code block, #135.
-   TypeDoc will now render members marked with `@deprecated` with a line through their name, #1381.
-   Added new `commentStyle` option which can be used to control what comments TypeDoc will parse.

    | Value | Behavior                               |
    | ----- | -------------------------------------- |
    | JSDoc | Use block comments starting with `/**` |
    | Block | Use all block comments                 |
    | Line  | Use `//` comments                      |
    | All   | Use both block and line comments       |

-   TypeDoc will now warn if part of a comment will be overwritten due to use of `@inheritDoc` instead of silently dropping part of the comment.
-   Added support for inline `@inheritDoc` tags, #1480.
-   It is now possible to link directly to a specific overload, #1326.
-   The JSON output will now include URLs to the file on the remote repository if possible.
-   Added a new `visibilityFilters` option which controls the available filters on a page.
-   TypeDoc will now try to place block elements on a new line in HTML output, resulting in less overwhelming diffs when rebuilding docs, #1923.
-   Added `blockTags`, `inlineTags`, `modifierTags` to control which tags TypeDoc will allow when parsing comments.
    If a tag not in in one of these options is encountered, TypeDoc will produce a warning and use context clues to determine how to parse the tag.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed off by one error in warnings for types referenced but not included in the documentation.
-   TypeDoc will no longer render a `Type Parameters` heading if there are no type parameters in some cases.
-   Improved source location detection for constructors.
-   Improved comment discovery on destructured exported functions, #1770.
-   Links which refer to members within a reference reflection will now correctly resolve to the referenced reflection's member, #1770.
-   Correctly detect optional parameters in JavaScript projects using JSDoc, #1804.
-   Fixed identical anchor links for reflections with the same name, #1845.
-   TypeDoc will now automatically inherit documentation from classes `implements` by other interfaces/classes.
-   Fixed `@inheritDoc` on accessors, #1927.
-   JS exports defined as `exports.foo = ...` will now be converted as variables rather than properties.
-   `searchCategoryBoosts` are now correctly computed for all categories, #1960.
-   The `excludeNotDocumented` option will no longer hide a module if it has a documentation comment, #1948.
-   Prevent `--excludeNotDocumented` from hiding properties of type literals (`a` in `function fn(p: { a: string })`), #1752.
-   Allow `cts` and `mts` extensions in packages resolution mode, #1952.
-   Corrected schema generation for https://typedoc.org/schema.json

    Using `defaultValue` on `EnumMember` reflections is now deprecated, and will be broken in 0.23.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed invalid type output in some uncommon edge cases, TypeDoc also now renders fewer superfluous parenthesis when creating types.

-   TypeDoc will now warn if a project name/version cannot be inferred from a package.json file rather than using `undefined`, #1907.

### Thanks!

-   @ejuda
-   @matteobruni
-   @schlusslicht

## v0.22.14 (2022-04-07)

-   @nlepage
-   @ychan167

## v0.22.13 (2022-03-06)

### Features

### Features

-   Added support for TypeScript 4.5, #1798.

### Bug Fixes

-   If file exports a symbol both under it's real name and as `default`, the `default` export will now always be the renamed symbol, #1795.
-   TypeDoc will no longer crash if a symbol is defined both as a normal class (and optional interface) and as a property, as is used for global Node types in older `@types/node` versions, Gerrit0/typedoc-plugin-missing-exports#5.

## v0.22.9 (2021-11-14)

### Features

-   TypeDoc will now detect and warn if multiple instances of the package are loaded. This usually means that a plugin has its own version of TypeDoc installed, which will lead to things breaking in unexpected ways.
    It will only work if both loaded TypeDocs are v0.22.9 or later.
-   TypeDoc will now automatically load packages with `typedoc-theme` in their keywords.
    Plugins which define a custom theme should include this keyword so that they can be automatically collected and displayed at https://typedoc.org/guides/themes/.

    See the documentation in [custom-themes.md](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/blob/master/internal-docs/custom-themes.md) for details.

### Bug Fixes

-   Actually fixed `@category` tag incorrectly appearing on function types if used on a type alias, #1745.
-   Fix error in console when a page contains no documentation items.

### Thanks!

-   @RunDevelopment

### Thanks!

-   @capraynor
-   @srmagura

## v0.22.5 (2021-10-02)

### Features

-   TypeDoc will now recognize `@param` comments for destructured parameters and rename `__namedParameters` to the name specified
    in the `@param` comment if the number of `@param` comments match the number of parameters, resolves #1703.
-   The `intentionallyNotExported` option may now include file names/paths to limit its scope, for example, the following
    will suppress warnings from `Foo` in `src/foo.ts` not being exported, but will not suppress warnings if another `Foo`
    declared in `src/utils/foo.ts` is not exported.
    ```json
    {
        "intentionallyNotExported": ["src/foo.ts:Foo"]
    }
    ```
-   The `--emit` option can now be used to more finely control what TypeDoc will emit.
    | Value | Behavior |
    | --- | --- |
    | `both` | Emit both documentation and JS. |
    | `docs` | Emit documentation, but not JS (default). |
    | `none` | Emit nothing, just convert and run validation. |
    | `true` | Alias for `both`, for backwards compatibility. Will be removed in 0.23. |
    | `false` | Alias for `docs`, for backwards compatibility. Will be removed in 0.23. |

### Bug Fixes

-   TypeDoc will now only create one highlighter for rendering code, saving ~200-500ms for rendering time.
-   For compatibility with JSDoc, TypeDoc will now strip `<caption>` elements from `@example` tags, resolves #1679.
-   TypeScript's `emitDeclarationOnly` compiler option is now supported, resolves #1716.
-   Fixed discovery of tsconfig.json when the provided path ends in `.json`, resolves #1712.
-   Fixed a crash when converting the `globalThis` namespace, could only be caused by a plugin.

## v0.22.4 (2021-09-18)

### Features

-   Flag option types like `validation` can now be set to true/false to enable/disable all flags within them.
-   Source code links now work with Bitbucket repositories, resolves #1615.
-   Added `githubPages` option (default: true), which will create a `.nojekyll` page in the generated output, resolves #1680.
-   `MarkdownEvent` is now exported, resolves #1696.

### Bug Fixes

-   Comments on function implementations with overloaded signatures will now be correctly handled, fixes #1697.

### Thanks!

-   @srmagura

## v0.22.3 (2021-09-12)

### Bug Fixes

-   Switched the default highlighting themes back to `light-plus` and `dark-plus`, they were accidentally set to `min-light` and `min-dark` in v0.22.0.

### Features

-   Added new `validation` option which can be used to disable checks for non-exported symbols.
    On the command line, this can be specified with `--validation.notExported true`, or in an options file with:
    ```json
    {
        "validation": {
            "notExported": true
        }
    }
    ```
-   Added invalidLink to `validation` option, deprecated `listInvalidSymbolLinks`, which will be removed in 0.23.

## v0.22.2 (2021-09-11)

### Bug Fixes

-   Fix background color of tables in dark mode, closes #1684.

## v0.22.1 (2021-09-10)

### Bug Fixes

-   Validation for non-exported symbols will now only produce one warning per symbol, instead of one warning per reference.
-   Syntax highlighting when the preferred color scheme is dark but dark theme is not explicitly selected will now properly use the dark highlighting theme.

# v0.22.0 (2021-09-10)

### Breaking Changes

-   The `packages` and `entryPoints` options have been combined.
    To migrate configurations which used `packages`, replace `packages` with `entryPoints` and set `entryPointStrategy` to `packages`.
-   Renamed `disableOutputCheck` to `cleanOutputDir` to more clearly reflect its behavior.
-   The `highlightTheme` option has been split into `lightHighlightTheme` and `darkHighlightTheme`.
-   Removed poorly documented / poorly behaved `toc` option.
-   HTML output is now rendered with JSX instead of Handlebars, closes #1631.
    This change provides major performance benefits, reducing rendering time by up to 10x for several benchmarked projects.
    It also allows themes to be easily type checked, preventing mistakes when creating custom themes.
    Removing Handlebars also fixed memory leaks when `--watch` was specified due to Handlebar's caching mechanism.
    This change breaks all existing custom themes, so a theme created for v0.21 or earlier will not work in v0.22.
    See [internal-docs/custom-themes.md](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/blob/v0.22.0/internal-docs/custom-themes.md) for documentation on how to create a custom theme in v0.22.
-   Removed the minimal theme that has been mostly broken for a long time.
-   Changed the default `entryPointStrategy` from `expand` to `resolve`.
-   Paths in config files will now be resolved relative to the config file instead of relative to the current working directory.
-   Exclude patterns are now checked against files instead of against each part of the path as traversed, #1399.
    This means that an exclude of `**/someDir` will **not** exclude files in that directory. To exclude files in a directory, specify `**/someDir/**`.

### Features

-   Added support for light/dark mode to the default theme, closes #1641.
-   Added support for custom CSS with the new `customCss` option, closes #1060.
-   Added support for linking to third party documentation sites, closes #131. See [internal-docs/third-party-symbols.md](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/blob/v0.22.0/internal-docs/third-party-symbols.md)
    for documentation on how to create a plugin which enables this.
    Support for linking to MDN for global types is provided by [typedoc-plugin-mdn-links](https://github.com/Gerrit0/typedoc-plugin-mdn-links).
-   Added `entryPointStrategy` to reduce confusion from new TypeDoc users on handling of entry points.
    There are three possible options:
    | Option | Behavior |
    | --- | --- |
    | resolve (default) | Expects all entry points to be contained within the root level tsconfig project. If a directory is given, includes `<directory>/index` as the entry point. |
    | expand | Expects all entry points to be contained within the root level tsconfig project. If a directory is given, files within it are recursively expanded. This was the default behavior in v0.21. |
    | packages | Corresponds to `--packages` in v0.21, behaves as documented in the Monorepo section in the readme. |
-   Added support for `typedocMain` in package.json when using the `packages` strategy for resolving entry points.
-   Produce warnings when documentation is missing exports, closes #1653. If using TypeDoc's API, this behavior is available through calling `application.validate(project)`.
-   Added support for detecting "`as const` enums", closes #1675.
-   Added `hideLegend` option, closes #1108.
-   Added performance measurements to debug logging (`--logLevel Verbose`)
-   String literal indexed access types will create links to their referencing member if possible, closes #1226.

### Bug Fixes

-   Support inclusion patterns when expanding input files, closes #1399.
-   Arrow keys can no longer select hidden search results.
-   The Legend header will no longer be included if there is nothing in the legend.
-   If a non-function uses `@param`, the name will not be dropped when rendering, closes #1410.

### API Breaking Changes

-   TypeDoc now specifies the `"export"` key in `package.json`, preventing plugins from importing internal paths.
    TypeDoc should now export all necessary structures (potentially marked with `@internal` if likely to change) from the root export.
-   The `ReflectionKind` values for `Project`, `Module`, `Namespace`, and `Enum` have changed.
-   Removed deprecated logger functions.
-   Dropped support for legacy plugins which use `export=`. Plugins are now required to export a `load` function.
-   Remove `TypeParameterType`, references to type parameters have produced a `ReferenceType` since v0.20.0.
-   Types no longer have a `clone` method. It inconsistently performed deep or shallow clones, and was not used by TypeDoc.
-   Types no longer contain an `equals` method. It was occasionally correct for medium-complexity types, and always incorrect for more complicated types.
