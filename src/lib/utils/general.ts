 * of internal code, we only ever want to pass 'a' or 'b' to it. Plugins on the other
 * hand need to be able to pass any string to it. Overloads similar to this are used
 * in the {@link Options} class.
 *
 * This is also used to prevent TypeDoc code from using deprecated methods which will
 * be removed in a future release.

 * function over(flag: 'a' | 'b'): string
 * function over(flag: IfStrict<string, never>): string
 * function over(flag: string): string { return flag }
